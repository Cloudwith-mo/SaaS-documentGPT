FINAL BUG FIX - EXECUTION ORDER

EXTENDED MINI-TEST SERIES

Test 6: How many DOMContentLoaded listeners?
TWO - Line 1484 and Line 2420

Test 7: What does first listener do?
FATAL - Calls setActiveDoc() IMMEDIATELY (line 1485)

Test 8: When does initAuth() run?
LATER - In second listener (line 2420+)

Test 9: What is the problem?
CRITICAL - setActiveDoc runs BEFORE initAuth
Result: state.user = null (guest mode not initialized)
Event listeners attach but user context missing

ROOT CAUSE

Execution Order:
1. DOMContentLoaded fires
2. Line 1485: setActiveDoc(state.activeId) runs
3. state.user is still NULL (initAuth not called yet)
4. Event listeners attach but without user context
5. Line 2420+: initAuth() finally runs
6. state.user gets guest ID
7. BUT event listeners already attached with null user
8. Clicks fail because user_id is undefined

FIX APPLIED

Removed premature setActiveDoc call at line 1485
Now setActiveDoc only runs AFTER initAuth completes

EXPECTED FIXES

ALL features should now work:
- Guest mode initialized FIRST
- state.user has guest ID
- Upload button works
- Chat sends messages
- AI agents trigger
- Settings opens
- All buttons functional

Critical Tests:
1. Upload AAAI PDF
2. Chat "Hello"
3. Summary agent
4. Settings modal
5. Check browser console for errors

DIAGNOSIS SUMMARY

9 Mini-Tests Total:
- Test 1-5: Found IIFE timing issue (FIXED)
- Test 6-9: Found execution order issue (FIXED)

Root Causes:
1. IIFE ran before DOM ready (FIXED)
2. setActiveDoc ran before initAuth (FIXED)

Both issues prevented guest mode initialization.
