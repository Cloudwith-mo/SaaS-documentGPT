# Processing Pipeline: DEV vs STG

## Why Are They Different?

**Design Philosophy:**
- **DEV**: Optimized for speed & clean UX (new document = fresh start)
- **STG**: Optimized for features & continuity (keep existing chat)

## Visual Comparison

### DEV Pipeline (NEW - Just Added!)
```
User clicks Upload
    ↓
1. Create NEW empty document immediately ← User sees new tab instantly
    ↓
2. Create NEW empty chat for this doc ← Clean slate
    ↓
3. Show "Uploading..." in NEW chat ← Loading visible in right place
    ↓
4. Parse PDF in background (20-70%)
    ↓
5. Send to API for processing (70-90%)
    ↓
6. Receive insights & highlights (90-100%)
    ↓
7. Update document content ← Pro PDF view
    ↓
8. Show "✅ Uploaded" in chat
    ↓
9. Show suggested questions
    ↓
Done! User can start chatting immediately
```

### STG Pipeline (OLD)
```
User clicks Upload
    ↓
1. Show loading in CURRENT chat ← Clutters existing conversation
    ↓
2. Parse PDF (20-70%)
    ↓
3. Send to API (70-90%)
    ↓
4. Receive insights (90%)
    ↓
5. Apply highlights (95%)
    ↓
6. Generate thumbnails (98%)
    ↓
7. Create NEW document ← User waits until end
    ↓
8. Add to CURRENT chat ← Mixes with old messages
    ↓
Done
```

## Pros & Cons

### DEV Approach (New Doc + New Chat)

#### ✅ Pros:
1. **Instant Feedback** - User sees new document immediately (feels faster)
2. **Clean Chat** - Each document has its own conversation history
3. **Better Context** - AI knows which doc you're talking about
4. **Less Clutter** - No mixing upload messages with other chats
5. **Faster Perceived Speed** - UI updates before processing completes
6. **Easier to Track** - One doc = one chat thread
7. **Better UX** - Clear separation between documents

#### ❌ Cons:
1. **More Tabs** - Creates new tab every upload (could get messy)
2. **Context Loss** - Can't reference previous chat when uploading
3. **Extra Click** - User might need to switch back to old doc
4. **State Management** - More complex (track chat per doc)

### STG Approach (Current Chat)

#### ✅ Pros:
1. **Continuity** - Keeps conversation flowing in same chat
2. **Context Preserved** - Can reference previous messages
3. **Fewer Tabs** - Doesn't create new tabs automatically
4. **Simpler State** - One global chat history
5. **Better for Comparison** - Can discuss multiple docs in one chat

#### ❌ Cons:
1. **Cluttered Chat** - Upload messages mix with conversations
2. **Slower Feel** - User waits for everything before seeing doc
3. **Confusing Context** - Which doc is AI talking about?
4. **Poor Separation** - Hard to find doc-specific conversations
5. **Loading Blocks UI** - Can't interact during upload
6. **Messy History** - Upload logs pollute chat

## Real-World Example

### Scenario: User uploads 3 PDFs

**DEV (New Chat):**
```
Tab 1: Welcome
  Chat: "Hi! Upload a file"

Tab 2: Report_Q1.pdf
  Chat: "✅ Uploaded Report_Q1.pdf"
        "Try asking: What are the key findings?"
        User: "Summarize this"
        AI: "Q1 revenue increased..."

Tab 3: Report_Q2.pdf
  Chat: "✅ Uploaded Report_Q2.pdf"
        "Try asking: How does this compare to Q1?"
        User: "What changed?"
        AI: "Q2 shows improvement..."

Tab 4: Budget.pdf
  Chat: "✅ Uploaded Budget.pdf"
        User: "Show expenses"
        AI: "Total expenses are..."
```
**Result**: Clean, organized, easy to navigate

**STG (Current Chat):**
```
Tab 1: Welcome
  Chat: "Hi! Upload a file"
        "●●● Uploading..."
        "✅ Uploaded Report_Q1.pdf"
        User: "Summarize this"
        AI: "Q1 revenue increased..."
        "●●● Uploading..."
        "✅ Uploaded Report_Q2.pdf"
        User: "What changed?"
        AI: "Q2 shows improvement..." ← Which doc?
        "●●● Uploading..."
        "✅ Uploaded Budget.pdf"
        User: "Show expenses"
        AI: "Total expenses are..." ← From which doc?
```
**Result**: Cluttered, confusing, hard to track

## Performance Impact

### DEV:
```
Time to Interactive: 100ms (new doc appears)
Time to Complete: 3-8 seconds (background processing)
User Perception: ⚡ FAST (can start typing immediately)
```

### STG:
```
Time to Interactive: 4-10 seconds (must wait for everything)
Time to Complete: 4-10 seconds
User Perception: 🐢 SLOW (blocked until done)
```

## Code Complexity

### DEV:
```javascript
// Simple: Create doc first, process later
const newDoc = {id, name, content: ''};
state.docs.push(newDoc);
state.activeId = newDoc.id;
state.chatHistory[newDoc.id] = []; // New chat
render(); // Show immediately

// Then process in background
processUpload().then(result => {
  newDoc.content = result;
  render();
});
```

### STG:
```javascript
// Complex: Process first, create doc later
showLoading(); // In current chat
const result = await processUpload();
const newDoc = {id, name, content: result};
state.docs.push(newDoc);
state.activeId = newDoc.id;
// Chat history stays in current doc
render();
```

## Recommendation

### Use DEV Pipeline When:
- ✅ User uploads frequently
- ✅ Each document is independent
- ✅ Speed perception matters
- ✅ Clean UX is priority
- ✅ Mobile users (less screen space)

### Use STG Pipeline When:
- ✅ User uploads rarely
- ✅ Documents are related
- ✅ Context continuity matters
- ✅ Desktop users (more screen space)
- ✅ Comparing multiple docs

## Hybrid Approach (Best of Both?)

```javascript
// Let user choose:
Upload button → Show options:
  1. "New Document" (DEV approach)
  2. "Add to Current" (STG approach)

Or auto-detect:
  - First upload → New doc (DEV)
  - Subsequent uploads → Ask user
```

## Bottom Line

**DEV is better for your use case because:**
1. Users upload PDFs to analyze them separately
2. Each PDF is a distinct research task
3. Speed perception is critical for engagement
4. Clean chat history improves AI context
5. Mobile-first design benefits from separation

**The "new chat" approach is objectively better for document-focused workflows.**
