# Document Context Fix - October 19, 2024

## Problem
Chatbot couldn't answer questions about uploaded documents:
- User uploads PDF
- User asks: "What are the key findings?"
- Bot responds: "I can't access specific papers..."

## Root Cause
Frontend was only sending the user's question to `/chat` endpoint without including the document content.

## Solution
Modified `sendChat()` function to include document context in the message:

```javascript
// Get active document content
const doc = state.docs.find(d => d.id === state.activeId);
const docContent = doc?.content || document.getElementById('editor')?.textContent || '';

// Build message with context if document exists
let messageContent = msg;
if (docContent && docContent.length > 50) {
    messageContent = `Document context:\n${docContent.slice(0, 8000)}\n\nUser question: ${msg}`;
}
```

## Changes Made

### Frontend (`backup.html`)
- Added document content extraction from active doc or editor
- Prepends first 8000 chars of document to user's question
- Only adds context if document has meaningful content (>50 chars)

## Testing

**Before**:
```
User: "What are the key findings?"
Bot: "I can't access specific papers, but I can help..."
```

**After**:
```
User: "What are the key findings?"
Bot: "The key findings are that usage grew by 300% in the first quarter, 
     the most common use case is writing assistance, and the average 
     session length is 12 minutes. Want to know more?"
```

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - Chatbot now has document context and can answer questions about uploaded PDFs

## Deployment
- Frontend deployed: 227 KiB
- Live at: https://documentgpt.io/backup.html

**Impact**: Users can now have meaningful conversations about their uploaded documents
