## Blockers & Mitigation

**Blocker:** PostHog setup takes too long  
**Mitigation:** Use Google Analytics 4 instead (faster setup)

**Blocker:** Video editing takes 2+ hours per video  
**Mitigation:** Use CapCut templates, batch record 5 videos at once

**Blocker:** Email automation complex  
**Mitigation:** Start with manual emails to first 10 users, automate later

**Blocker:** Student verification requires manual review  
**Mitigation:** Auto-approve .edu emails, manual review for others
