## ❌ CRITICAL GAPS (Must Fix - 45 min)

### 1. PDF Upload Route Missing (5 min) 🔴
**Issue**: `/upload-url` endpoint returns 403
**Impact**: Users cannot upload PDFs
**Fix**: Add API Gateway route
```bash
# Run this command
aws apigateway get-resources --rest-api-id i1dy8i3692
# Then add /upload-url route following GAPS_FINAL.md
```

### 2. SES Email Verification (5 min) 🔴
**Issue**: noreply@documentgpt.io not verified
**Impact**: Email agent doesn't work
**Fix**: Verify email in AWS SES console or use verified email

### 3. PDF Upload UI Not Wired (15 min) 🔴
**Issue**: Frontend doesn't call upload endpoint
**Impact**: No way to upload PDFs from UI
**Fix**: Add upload handler to app.html

### 4. Error Handling Missing (10 min) 🟡
**Issue**: Users don't see error messages
**Impact**: Confusing when limits hit
**Fix**: Add error modal to app.html

### 5. Usage Display Not Shown (10 min) 🟡
**Issue**: Users can't see their usage stats
**Impact**: Don't know how many chats left
**Fix**: Add usage counter to UI

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT GAPS (Should Fix - 2 hours)

### 6. ✅ Stripe Integration - DONE
**Status**: Fully wired (backend + frontend)
**Features**: Checkout, webhooks, billing portal
**Working**: Users can upgrade to Premium

### 7. Document Download (10 min) 🟡
**Issue**: Can't download uploaded documents
**Impact**: Users can view but not download
**Fix**: Add download button

### 8. Password Reset (30 min) 🟡
**Issue**: No "forgot password" flow
**Impact**: Users locked out if they forget password
**Fix**: Add Cognito password reset flow

## 📊 FILE STRUCTURE ANALYSIS

### Current Structure (Messy but Functional)
```
SaaS-documentGPT/
├── web/              # Frontend (17MB) ✅
├── lambda/           # Backend (100MB) ⚠️ MESSY
├── docs/             # Documentation (60+ files) ⚠️ TOO MANY
├── scripts/          # Deployment scripts ✅
└── config/           # AWS configs ✅
```

### Optimal Structure (For Future)

└── config/           # Configuration files
```

### Gap: Lambda Folder is Messy 🟡
**Issue**: 50+ dependency folders in root
**Impact**: Hard to navigate, confusing
**Priority**: Low - works fine, just ugly
**Fix**: Move to `lambda/deps/` or `lambda/vendor/`
**Time**: 30 min (but risky, could break deployment)
**Recommendation**: Leave as-is until after first users

### Gap: Too Many Docs 🟡
**Issue**: 60+ markdown files in docs/
**Impact**: Hard to find information
**Priority**: Low - doesn't affect users
**Fix**: Consolidate into 5-10 key docs
**Time**: 60 min
**Recommendation**: Do this after launch
